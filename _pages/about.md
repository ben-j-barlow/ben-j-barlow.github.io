I earned a Bachelor of Science in Data Science from the University of Warwick in 2020. Four years later, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a Master of Science in AI. I was awarded the maximal classification of a First-Class Honours and a Distinction in my bachelor's and master's, respectively. I received a cash reward for the best project in my class following my undergraduate dissertation and collaborated with academics at Stanford University during my postgraduate thesis.

In industry, I have 3 years of experience in Python development, data analysis, and ML. I've gained these skills during professional roles at a FinTech, HealthTech, and in a research environment at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics.

I use my personal website to express my passion in data and AI, provide a portfolio of projects, and provide insights into my personal interests. I value my values passion and honesty above all else.
