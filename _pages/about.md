I earned a Bachelor of Science in Data Science from the University of Warwick in 2020. Four years later, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a Master of Science in AI. I was awarded the maximal classification of a First-Class Honours and a Distinction in my bachelor's and master's, respectively.

In industry, I have 3 years of experience in Python development, data analysis, and ML. I've gained these skills during professional roles at a FinTech, HealthTech, and in a research environment at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics.

My personal site aims to reshape Gen Z's perception of artificial intelligence and its applications through my blog, <a href='/blog/tag/ai-perception-gap/'>AI Perception Gap</a>. It also serves as a platform to highlight my portfolio of projects and explore my personal interests.
