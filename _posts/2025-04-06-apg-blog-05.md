Imagine an AI that could debate philosophy, orchestrate strategic decisions in warfare, and pass the bar exam—all in the same afternoon. That’s the idea behind Artificial General Intelligence: artificial intelligence that can match human capabilities across most or all economically valuable cognitive work.

Here we will learn why: XYZ

In past editions of AI Perception Gap, researchers at the Netherlands Forensic Insitute (NFI) and Google DeepMind achieved incredible feats - one used AI to identify victims of a plane crash, while the other solved the structures of 200 million proteins. But here’s the catch: DeepMind’s AI, trained for protein folding, was useless in identifying human remains. Likewise, the forensic AI had no clue about protein structures. These are both forms of “tool AI”—machines designed for one job and one job only, no matter how advanced.e

While tool AIs are narrow in focus, AGI is the ultimate generalist. It’s not limited to one skill—it can think, adapt, and solve problems across countless domains. Like a human, only it learns faster and performs better. AGI is the kind of system that could fold proteins in the morning and assist in forensic investigations by afternoon. It's tough to grasp the potential, so let’s break it down with real-world possibilities.

Think about how we learn. AGI could revolutionize education by tailoring lessons to each individual student. It could track how fast they grasp concepts, what they find difficult, and how they prefer to learn. It could notice when someone’s struggling or zoning out, using cues like facial expression or eye movement. This could mean students learning at their own rhythm, in ways that actually click—departing from traditional one-size-fits-all classrooms.

AGI could make education more personal than ever. It could learn how each student thinks, what they struggle with, and how fast they learn—then adjust teaching accordingly. It could observe the student in real-time through a camera and by reading subtle changes in facial expression, pupil dilation, and other concentration-related artefacts, it could evaluate which teaching techniques the student is responding too. This customisation would allow students to learn at their own pace in their own way, deviating from the one style for all approach traditionally found with a single teacher in a classroom.

In the medical world, AGI could become a true genius—one that never tires, never loses focus, and works through the night without faltering. With next-generation devices continuously measuring in-patient health data, AGI could absorb and analyse everything in real-time, guiding doctors where they’re most needed. With that level of insight, healthcare could shift towards preventing emergencies instead of just responding to them.

Unlike tool AI, which work on pre-defined tasks, AGI will have the freedom to make autonomous decisions across a wide range of challenges—just like a human. This autonomy is aligned with the sci-fi-inspired perception of AI that inspired AI Perception Gap.

AGI will transform warfare. Think Skynet from The Terminator—an AI that turned on humanity after launching nuclear attacks, sparking a global war. That’s science fiction, but the trajectory isn’t far off: AGI could process real-time satelitte data, pinpoint threats, and craft tactical strategies. And once planned, these strategies could be executed by swarms of autonomous drones or robot infantry. Every step, from satellite surveillance to surgical strike, could run in seconds without a single human needing to intervene. The first country to master AGI won’t just lead—they’ll dominate.

This mirrors the nuclear arms race of the 20th century—but this time, the stakes stretch beyond deterrence. When one superpower (USA) is a democracy and the other (China) an authoritarian state, AGI doesn’t just challenge military balance—it amplifies global instability. Democracies are slowed by laws, public opinion, and ethical constraints. Authoritarian states? Move as fast as their capabilities allow.

In anticipation of AGI’s strategic value, the US acted early. On October 7, 2022—days before the release of ChatGPT which is considered an early stage AGI (emerging AGI)—the US set legislation aimed at slowing China’s military and economic advancement in AGI. They banned the most powerful AI chips, hundreds of thousands of which are needed for an organisation to advance from today’s AI towards AGI, from being exported to China. This move - which was about remaining a military, economic, and geopolitical superpower - birthed an AI chip cold war.

Limited supply has created a booming black market. TikTok’s Chinese-based parent company ByteDance are known to circumvent export restrictions by renting access to AI chips housed in Southeast Asian data centres run by US firms. The US, realizing this workaround, followed by imposing restrictions on allies in Asia and Europe. Oddly enough, the US are happy to sell Singapore F-35 fighter jets, but AI chips? Off-limits.

One striking story was shared on the Lex Fridman podcast. A tech exec saw someone flying from San Francisco to China in first class with a small box—just big enough to hold a few GPUs. The math is simple: buy a load for $100k in the US, sell it for double in China, pocket the difference, and commute in luxury on the profits. It’s not just a market—it’s a lifestyle.

So it’s fair to ask—are these export controls enough? Can the US really expect to win the AGI race by blocking hardware? The next section dives into China’s DeepSeek breakthrough—a moment that suggests the answer might already be no.

The AI world will always remember 20th Janruary 2025; the day the little-known Chinese start up DeepSeek announced themselves as an AI giant. Despite their AI chip access being choked by US restrictions, their AI was ranked more intelligent than some US counterparts. Their timing, on the day Trump was sworn in as president, felt like more than coincidence. Was it a message? Two can play this AI game.

The explanation of how DeepSeek’s were able to compete on the world stage lays in their DNA. CEO Liang Wenfeng, alumni of the prestigious Zhejiang University, has been passionnate about AI for years. Prior to US restrictions, he reportedly acquired 10,000 of the highest performing chips for predicting stock prices with AI at his Chinese-based hedgefund.

Using profits from his hedgefund’s $10+bn portfolio to bankroll DeepSeek since its founding in May 2023, Wenfeng attracted the brightest AI minds in China with lucrative salaries. After adding thousands of less powerful chip alternatives, exempt from US restrictions, to his existing chip stockpile, Wenfeng and his team improved the efficiency of each chip through unprecedented innovation.

Their AI is built modularly, taking inspiration from the modulat structure in the human brain which preserves energy. Instead of the whole brain being active at once, the visual cortex activated when processing data from the eye, or the amygdala switches on in response to danger. This technique is not entirely new - open AI are thought to do the same - but DeepSeek do it differently. Further, DeepSeek created bespoke code to replace NVIDIA’s AI chip operating manual. Think of a manufacturer producing hundreds of cars. Instead of focusing energy on proudction volume and using a readily available factory-made gearbox, DeepSeek built their own hand-tuned racing transmission. US frontier labs have too tinkered with the gearbox, but DeepSeek were the first to revolutionise AI models by doing with extreme precision.

Quite simply, necessity was the mother of innovation. The result? A watershed moment. DeepSeek out-innovated those with unlimited resources, reinforcing existing doubt over the effectiveness of the US’s export restrictions. The DeepSeek moment is a metaphor for a wider narrative: If China can use limited compute and unlimited innovation to compete with the US’s emerging AGI in 2025, will China be able to hold its own in the race to AGI over the next five to ten years?
